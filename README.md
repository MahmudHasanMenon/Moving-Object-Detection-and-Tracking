# Moving-Object-Detection-and-Tracking
The Video surveillance system has long been in use to monitor sensitive areas for public, commercial and national security. Moreover, Multiple objects detection and tracking are amongst the most important tasks in computer vision-based surveillance and activity recognition since there are a number of critical challenges to detecting objects perfectly such as noise, illumination changes, shadow effect, self and mutual occlusion. This thesis work proposes video processing and a real-time multiple objects detection & tracking method and compares its performance with existing methods. The proposed system takes video input from a surveillance camera and then compresses the video using video codecs after that images are extracted from the video and then models a background to get the foreground object using the Background subtraction method. After detecting the object proposed system proposes pixel-level post-processing such as noise and shadow removal as object classification and tracking highly depend on the correctness of object segmentation. Finally proposed system uses temporal information about objects such as trajectory, posture, speed and direction and uses a bounding box method to extract the object perfectly. In terms of accuracy and efficiency, the proposed method is shown to be highly accurate in determining the number of moving objects and also fast in tracking them in the scene.
